Things What Remain To Do
========================

* look into password handling best practices (e.g., use `char[]` and wipe it)
  vs. the Servlet API (e.g., handle everything as a `String`)
* add ETags and `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` support for documents
* add more configuration details for things like key algorithms, etc.
* key rotation!
